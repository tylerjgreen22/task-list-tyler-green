Task List DOM project
Original Code from Traversy Media: https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762218#overview

I made some changes to the original, I used bootstrap instead of materialize css, I also changed some of the functions in the app.js to not have so much repeated code
